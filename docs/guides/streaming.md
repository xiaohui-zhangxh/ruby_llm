# Streaming Responses
{: .no_toc }

RubyLLM provides streaming capabilities that allow you to receive AI responses in real-time as they're being generated, rather than waiting for the complete response. This creates a more interactive experience, especially for long responses or applications with real-time UI updates.

After reading this guide, you will know:

*   How to initiate a streaming chat request.
*   How to process the streamed `Chunk` objects.
*   How the final accumulated message is handled.
*   How to integrate streaming with web frameworks like Rails and Sinatra.
*   How streaming interacts with Tools.
*   Performance considerations for streaming.

## Basic Streaming

To stream responses, simply provide a block to the `ask` method on a `Chat` object.

```ruby
chat = RubyLLM.chat

puts "Assistant:"
chat.ask "Write a short story about a adventurous ruby gem." do |chunk|
  # The block receives RubyLLM::Chunk objects as they arrive
  print chunk.content # Print content fragment immediately
end
# => (Output appears incrementally) Once upon a time, in the vast digital...
```

RubyLLM handles the underlying complexities of different provider streaming formats (like Server-Sent Events) and yields standardized `Chunk` objects.

## Understanding Chunks

Each object yielded to the block is an instance of `RubyLLM::Chunk`, which inherits from `RubyLLM::Message`. It contains the partial information received in that specific part of the stream.

Key attributes of a `Chunk`:

*   `chunk.content`: The text fragment received in this chunk (can be `nil` or empty for some chunks, especially those containing only metadata or tool calls).
*   `chunk.role`: Always `:assistant` for streamed response chunks.
*   `chunk.model_id`: The model generating the response (usually present).
*   `chunk.tool_calls`: A hash containing partial or complete tool call information if the model is invoking a [Tool]({% link guides/tools.md %}). The arguments might be streamed incrementally.
*   `chunk.input_tokens`: Total input tokens for the request (often `nil` until the final chunk).
*   `chunk.output_tokens`: Cumulative output tokens *up to this chunk* (behavior varies by provider, often only accurate in the final chunk).

{: .warning }
Do not rely on token counts being present or accurate in every chunk. They are typically finalized only in the last chunk or the final returned message.

## Accumulated Response

Even when you provide a block for streaming, the `ask` method *still* returns the complete, final `RubyLLM::Message` object once the entire response (including any tool interactions) is finished.

```ruby
chat = RubyLLM.chat
final_message = nil

puts "Assistant:"
final_message = chat.ask "Write a short haiku about programming." do |chunk|
  print chunk.content
end

# The block finishes, and ask returns the complete message
puts "\n--- Final Message ---"
puts final_message.content
# => Code flows like water,
# => Logic builds a new world now,
# => Bugs swim in the stream.

puts "Total Tokens: #{(final_message.input_tokens || 0) + (final_message.output_tokens || 0)}"
```

This allows you to easily get the final result for storage or further processing, even after handling the stream for UI purposes.

## Web Application Integration

Streaming is particularly useful in web applications for providing immediate feedback.

### Rails with Turbo Streams

In a Rails application using Hotwire/Turbo, you can broadcast stream updates from a background job.

```ruby
# app/jobs/chat_stream_job.rb
class ChatStreamJob < ApplicationJob
  queue_as :default

  def perform(chat_id, user_message, stream_target_id)
    chat = Chat.find(chat_id) # Assuming acts_as_chat model
    full_response = ""

    # Broadcast an initial placeholder
    Turbo::StreamsChannel.broadcast_replace_to(
      "chat_#{chat.id}",
      target: stream_target_id,
      partial: "messages/streaming_message",
      locals: { content: "Thinking..." }
    )

    chat.ask(user_message) do |chunk|
      full_response << (chunk.content || "")
      # Broadcast updates, replacing the placeholder content
      Turbo::StreamsChannel.broadcast_replace_to(
        "chat_#{chat.id}",
        target: stream_target_id,
        partial: "messages/streaming_message",
        locals: { content: full_response } # Send accumulated content
      )
    end

    # Optionally broadcast a final state or confirmation
  end
end

# app/views/messages/_streaming_message.html.erb
# <div id="<%= stream_target_id %>">
#   <%= simple_format(content) %>
# </div>

# In your controller:
# target_id = "stream_#{SecureRandom.uuid}"
# Render initial UI with <div id="<%= target_id %>"></div>
# ChatStreamJob.perform_later(chat.id, params[:message], target_id)
```

See the [Rails Integration Guide]({% link guides/rails.md %}#streaming-responses-with-hotwireturbo) for more detailed examples.

### Sinatra with Server-Sent Events (SSE)

SSE is a natural fit for streaming text responses.

```ruby
require 'sinatra'
require 'ruby_llm'
# ... configuration ...

get '/stream_chat' do
  content_type 'text/event-stream'
  stream(:keep_open) do |out|
    chat = RubyLLM.chat
    begin
      chat.ask(params[:prompt] || "Tell me a fun fact.") do |chunk|
        # Send each content chunk as an SSE data event
        out << "data: #{chunk.content.to_json}\n\n" if chunk.content
      end
      # Signal completion
      out << "event: complete\ndata: {}\n\n"
    rescue => e
      # Signal error
      out << "event: error\ndata: #{ { error: e.message }.to_json }\n\n"
    ensure
      out.close
    end
  end
end
```

## Error Handling During Streaming

Errors (like network issues, rate limits, or provider errors) can occur mid-stream. The `ask` method will raise the appropriate `RubyLLM::Error` subclass after the block execution finishes or is interrupted by the error.

```ruby
begin
  chat = RubyLLM.chat
  puts "Assistant:"
  chat.ask("Generate a very long response...") do |chunk|
    print chunk.content
    # Potential error occurs here
  end
rescue RubyLLM::Error => e
  puts "\n--- Error during streaming ---"
  puts "Error Type: #{e.class}"
  puts "Message: #{e.message}"
  # Check e.response for more details if needed
end
```

Refer to the [Error Handling Guide]({% link guides/error-handling.md %}) for details on specific error types.

## Streaming with Tools

When a chat interaction involves [Tools]({% link guides/tools.md %}), the streaming behavior has distinct phases:

1.  **Initial Response Stream:** Chunks are yielded as the model generates text *up to* the point where it decides to call a tool.
2.  **Tool Call Chunk(s):** One or more chunks containing `chunk.tool_calls` information are yielded. The arguments might be streamed incrementally depending on the provider.
3.  **Pause:** Streaming pauses while RubyLLM executes your tool's `execute` method.
4.  **Resumed Response Stream:** After the tool result is sent back to the model, streaming resumes, yielding chunks containing the model's final response incorporating the tool's output.

```ruby
chat = RubyLLM.chat(model: 'gpt-4o').with_tool(Weather) # Assumes Weather tool is defined

puts "Assistant:"
chat.ask("What's the weather in Berlin (52.52, 13.40)?") do |chunk|
  if chunk.tool_calls
    puts "\n[TOOL CALL DETECTED: #{chunk.tool_calls.values.first.name}]"
    # Arguments might be partial here: chunk.tool_calls.values.first.arguments
  elsif chunk.content
    print chunk.content
  end
end
# Output might look like:
# Assistant:
# Okay, let me check the weather for Berlin.
# [TOOL CALL DETECTED: weather] # Pause while tool executes
# The current weather in Berlin (52.52, 13.4) is 15°C with wind at 10 km/h.
```

Your streaming block needs to be prepared to handle chunks that contain text content, tool call information, or potentially just metadata.
